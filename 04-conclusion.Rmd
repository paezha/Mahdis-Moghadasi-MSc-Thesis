# Conclusion {-}


This study has embarked on a comprehensive journey through three decades of active travel behavior in Canada, from 1986 to 2015, leveraging data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to shed light on individual preferences and behaviors regarding walking and cycling. This exploration is particularly relevant as it spans a period of significant urban development, evolving societal attitudes towards health and the environment, and transformations in transportation infrastructure and policies.
Our results show that walking and cycling have consistently longer trip times, with shorter walking trips. Between 1986 and 2005, this gap shrunk, suggesting the intricate interactions between urban sprawl, a greater reliance on motorized transportation, and shifting preferences.git pus From 2005 to 2015, walking and cycling trip durations increased, likely influenced by heightened urbanization, health and sustainability concerns awareness, and urban planning shifts towards active transportation.

The study also uncovered trends in trip destinations, with cycling trips in 2015 primarily directed towards homes, schools, and workplaces, highlighting cycling's emergence as a sustainable commuting option. Walking trips predominantly originated from residential areas to workplaces and educational institutions, reflecting a shift towards walking for eco-friendly and health-conscious commuting.
However, the research encountered limitations, notably in handling weighted data for statistical tests and model diagnostics. The reliance on AIC, BIC, and log-likelihood values underscores the necessity for advanced tools that accommodate weighted data, addressing a methodological gap in statistical practices. The absence of cycling data further limits our analysis, presenting an avenue for future research to explore cycling trends and its potential as an alternative transportation mode for accessing cultural venues.

However, this research also confronts several limitations, including challenges in handling weighted data and the absence of specific cycling data. This points to a need for advanced statistical tools that accommodate weighted data to enhance the robustness of survey-based analyses.

Importantly, the use of impedance functions based on all-Canada data, including data from both CMAs and non-CMAs, necessitates careful consideration when applied to specific geographic regions. The impedance functions derived from a national dataset may not accurately reflect local travel behaviors and impedances due to regional variations in geography, urban design, and transportation infrastructure. For instance, urban areas might display shorter travel times and higher active transportation use due to better infrastructure and proximity of amenities, unlike rural or less densely populated regions.

Therefore, while national data provides a broad overview, it is crucial for urban planners and policymakers to consider local calibration of these functions. Tailoring impedance functions to specific regions can significantly enhance the precision of transportation models and policies, ensuring they are more aligned with local needs and conditions.

In conclusion, while this thesis sheds light on the resurgence of walking and cycling as prominent transportation modes in Canada, it also underscores the necessity for regional specificity in data application. Future research should focus on refining methodologies and expanding data collection to include underrepresented areas like cycling trends. This will not only fill current gaps but also aid in developing transportation systems that are both sustainable and attuned to the specific needs of diverse Canadian communities.
