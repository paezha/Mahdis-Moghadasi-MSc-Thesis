  Active travel, encompassing walking and cycling, is pivotal in fostering sustainable and healthy urban transportation systems. This thesis comprises two interconnected studies comprehensively addressing the complexities and imperatives of active travel analysis within the Canadian context. The first study embarks on a journey through three decades of active travel behavior in Canada. Utilizing data from Canada's General Social Survey, this research calibrates empirical impedance functions to elucidate individuals' willingness to undertake trips to various destinations by walking and cycling. The study not only reveals evolving patterns in active mobility but also offers valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers seeking to elevate walking and cycling as essential components of urban transportation in Canada. The second study evaluates geographic accessibility measures and data specifics necessary for assessing these modes in the Canadian context, shifting the focus to data prerequisites and sources critical for active accessibility analysis. This comprehensive analysis compares metrics, origin-destination considerations, geographic scales, and methods for calculating travel time and distance for walking and cycling. Beyond its relevance in Canada, this examination yields broader insights into the challenges and considerations associated with active travel accessibility analysis worldwide. These integrated studies contribute significantly to the ongoing discourse on active travel and accessibility, emphasizing the need for a transition from mobility-centric to accessibility-focused urban transportation policies. This transition holds the key to creating more sustainable, vibrant, and healthier cities for the future.

  Active travel, encompassing walking and cycling, has emerged as a vital component in pursuing sustainable, healthy, and efficient urban transportation systems. This thesis comprises two interrelated studies that collectively contribute to a comprehensive understanding of active travel behavior and its analysis within the Canadian context. At the first step, we focused on the data prerequisites and sources required for active accessibility analysis, systematically evaluates geographic accessibility measures and data specificity essential to assessing walking and cycling in the Canadian urban landscape. As accessibility increasingly takes center stage in urban transportation policies, it becomes imperative to understand the unique data requirements and methodological considerations for these non-motorized modes. This review thoroughly examines the accessibility measures used in recent literature and the various data sources and considerations associated with walking and cycling accessibility analysis. The comparative analysis encompasses metrics, origin-destination considerations, geographic scales, and travel time or distance calculations, shedding light on the complexities and nuances of active travel data analysis. In the subsequent phase of our research, we extensively analyzed active travel behavior trends in Canada, spanning three decades from 1986 to 2015. This study uses data from Canada's General Social Survey to examine individual preferences and behaviors related to walking and cycling. The focus is mainly on understanding how these behaviors vary according to different trip purposes and geographical contexts. Our approach involved the intricate calibration of empirical impedance functions to gain insights into the temporal willingness of individuals to travel to various destinations using active modes of transportation. This aspect of the study is crucial in quantifying the time individuals are willing to allocate to walking and cycling to reach their destinations. The investigation notably provides a historical perspective on the evolution of active mobility over the past 35 years. This historical analysis is pivotal in unraveling the changes in active travel behavior, influenced by factors such as urban development trends, societal attitudes towards health and environmental sustainability, and modifications in transportation infrastructure and policy frameworks. Our findings reveal significant and consistent disparities in trip durations between walking and cycling modes, accompanied by intriguing temporal variations over the years. Moreover, the study delves deeper into the analysis of specific destinations, uncovering evolving patterns and distance-decay effects in active travel behavior. These patterns indicate how the proximity of destinations influences the choice and duration of active travel.While primarily centered on the Canadian context, this study offers valuable insights that apply to the global discourse on sustainable and active transportation. It underscores the crucial role of active travel in shaping the future of urban transportation systems, advocating for a shift from traditional mobility-centric approaches to an accessibility-focused paradigm. This shift recognizes walking and cycling as alternative modes and fundamental elements of vibrant, sustainable urban environments. The comprehensive nature of this study goes beyond presenting empirical findings; it contributes significantly to the broader conversation on urban mobility, emphasizing the importance of these modes in promoting healthier, more sustainable, and livable cities. The research findings are a vital resource for urban planners, policymakers, and academic researchers worldwide, guiding decision-making processes to enhance urban mobility. By elucidating the data prerequisites and behavioral patterns associated with active travel, this thesis informs the development of strategies that foster urban settings conducive to active and sustainable transportation methods. These insights are instrumental in advancing our understanding of how to effectively integrate walking and cycling into the urban fabric, thereby supporting the evolution of urban areas towards greater sustainability and livability.
